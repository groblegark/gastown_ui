{"id":"gt-qfn","title":"Agents Page Real-time Updates","description":"## Context\n\nThe Agents page at `/agents` currently shows hardcoded mock data. Connect it to real Gas Town data.\n\n## Data Source\n\n`gt status --json` returns:\n```json\n{\n  \"agents\": [\n    {\"name\": \"mayor\", \"address\": \"mayor/\", \"session\": \"hq-mayor\", \"role\": \"coordinator\", \"running\": true, \"has_work\": false, \"state\": \"idle\", \"unread_mail\": 2}\n  ],\n  \"rigs\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"gastown_ui\",\n      \"polecats\": [\"furiosa\"],\n      \"has_witness\": true,\n      \"has_refinery\": true,\n      \"hooks\": [{\"agent\": \"gastown_ui/furiosa\", \"role\": \"polecat\", \"has_work\": true, \"bead_id\": \"gt-e81\"}]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## Existing Components\n\n- `AgentCard` - props: name, task, status (running|idle|error|stopped), progress, meta\n- `GridPattern` - background decoration\n- Current page: `src/routes/agents/+page.svelte`\n\n## Requirements\n\n1. Create `src/routes/agents/+page.server.ts` that calls `gt status --json`\n2. Transform agents + rig polecats into AgentCard format\n3. Update `+page.svelte` to use data from load function\n4. Show agent address as meta (e.g., \"gastown_ui/polecats/furiosa\")\n5. Link each card to `/agents/[id]` detail page\n6. Remove all mock data\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] Agents page shows real agents from gt status\n- [ ] Infrastructure agents (mayor, deacon) appear\n- [ ] Rig agents (witness, refinery) appear per rig\n- [ ] Polecats appear with their current work status\n- [ ] Cards link to detail pages\n- [ ] Error state if gt command fails","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"task","assignee":"gastown_ui/polecats/nux","created_at":"2026-01-06T00:11:31.507254+05:30","created_by":"amrit","updated_at":"2026-01-06T00:21:40.958967+05:30","closed_at":"2026-01-06T00:21:40.958967+05:30","close_reason":"Implemented: +page.server.ts calls gt status --json, +page.svelte uses load data"}
